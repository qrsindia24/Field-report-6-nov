    <h2>Field Trip Report</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The recent field trip to the <strong>Gurukul near the 3rd gate in Kurukshetra</strong> was organized with the primary objective of <strong>booking a campsite for an educational camp aimed at informing patients about health issues</strong>. The trip took place on <strong>November 6, 2024</strong>, and involved two participants: <strong>Jyoti and Gitanjali</strong>. This initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance community health education and provide resources for local residents.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>During the trip, essential information regarding <strong>QRS (Quality Reporting System)</strong> was communicated to a local doctor. The doctor, <strong>Dr. Suman Garg</strong>, can be reached at <strong>9996026316</strong>. Following this consultation, Jyoti and Gitanjali visited a nearby <strong>Gurudwara</strong> where they shared information about QRS with the local public, aiming to raise awareness about health services available to them.</p>

    <h3>Itinerary and Activities</h3>
    <p>The itinerary included the following key locations and activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visit to Gurukul</strong>: The primary destination for booking the campsite.</li>
        <li><strong>Consultation with Dr. Suman Garg</strong>: Discussing QRS and potential collaborations.</li>
        <li><strong>Outreach at Gurudwara</strong>: Engaging with local residents to inform them about QRS and gather feedback on community health needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>The field trip faced some challenges; notably, the manager of the Gurukul was not present during the visit, which limited direct engagement regarding the campsite booking. Furthermore, the initial response regarding the proposed camps was not overwhelmingly positive. However, interactions at the Gurudwara yielded a more favorable outcome, as many locals expressed interest in health education, particularly those suffering from knee pain. This indicates a potential opportunity for future health camps focused on addressing specific community health concerns.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In summary, the field trip to the Gurukul near the 3rd gate in Kurukshetra on November 6, 2024, aimed to secure a campsite for an educational health camp and raise awareness about QRS. While the absence of the manager at the Gurukul posed challenges in finalizing arrangements, the outreach efforts at the Gurudwara proved fruitful, with positive engagement from local residents suffering from knee pain. This indicates a clear need for health education initiatives in the community, suggesting that future camps could be highly beneficial and well-received. Overall, the trip highlighted both obstacles and opportunities in promoting health awareness and services in Kurukshetra.</p>
